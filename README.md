## Running the demo

To run the demo follow these steps:

1. [Head to CometChat Pro and create an account](https://app.cometchat.com/signup)
2. From the [dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/apps), add a new app called **"slack-clone"**
3. Select this newly added app from the list.
4. From the Quick Start copy the **APP_ID, APP_REGION and AUTH_KEY**. These will be used later.
5. Also copy the **REST_API_KEY** from the API & Auth Key tab(may no needed).
6. Navigate to the Users tab, and delete all the default users and groups leaving it clean **(very important)**.
7. Download the repository [here](https://github.com/Daltonic/slack-clone/archive/master.zip) or by running `git clone https://github.com/Daltonic/slack-clone.git` and open it in a code editor.
8. [Head to Firebase and create a new project](https://console.firebase.google.com)
9. Change file called **app.config.js** in the **src** folder of your project.

```js
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
export const COMETCHAT_CONSTANTS = {
    APP_ID: 'XXXXXXXXXX',
    REGION: 'US',
    AUTH_KEY: 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'
}

export const FIREBASE_CONSTANTS ={
    apiKey: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    authDomain: "slack-clone-c133a.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "slack-clone-c133a",
    storageBucket: "slack-clone-c133a.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    appId: "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
    measurementId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}

export { firebaseConfig, cometChat }
```
